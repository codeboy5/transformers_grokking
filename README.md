### Pytorch (RE)-Implementation of Grokking Phenomenon.

This is a pytorch re-implementation of [Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting on Small Algorithmic Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177).

I thought this would be a good paper to reproduce since this would allow me to code and train a GPT style model from scratch.
